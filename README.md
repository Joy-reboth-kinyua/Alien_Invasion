## Game Description

Alien Invasion is an exciting game where the player controls a ship at the bottom of the screen. The player can move the ship left and right using the arrow keys and shoot bullets with the spacebar. As the game begins, a fleet of aliens fills the sky, moving across and down the screen. The player's objective is to shoot and destroy the aliens. When all aliens are destroyed, a new, faster fleet appears. The game ends if an alien hits the player's ship or reaches the bottom of the screen, and the player loses a ship. The game is over when the player loses three ships. The game is built using the Pygame library for game functionalities and the SYS module to handle game exits.
