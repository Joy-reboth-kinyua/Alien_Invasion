In alien Invasion Game, the player controls a ship that appears at the bottom of the screen. The player can move the ship right to left using the arrow key and shoot bullets using the spacebar. When the game begins, the fleet of aliens fills the sky and moves across and down the screen. The player shoots and destroys the alien. If the player shoots all the aliens, a new fleet appears and moves faster than the previous fleet. If any alien hits the player's ship or reaches the bottom of the screen, the player loses a ship. If the player loses 3 ships, the game ends.
I used pygame modules containing functionalities needed to make games. I also used SYS module to exit the game when the player quits.
